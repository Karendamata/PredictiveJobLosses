# Predictive Job Losses using Neural Networks

In this project, the change in the number of jobs in the US during COVID-19 is predicted using four types of neural networks:

    1. Artificial Neural Network
    2. Recurrent Neural Network
    3. Long Short-Term Memory
    4. Gated-Recurrent Unit

Several features related to the economy and the pandemic are considered. A feature selection technique is applied, namely correlation-based feature selection (CFS), to initially identify the best subset of features for the models. Moreover, several number of neurons for the hidden layer was tested. For more information, please contact me.
